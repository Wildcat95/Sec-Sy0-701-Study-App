****** This is in no way a complete study guide for any certification. ******

This app was created in Pycharm in Ubuntu to be used in Linux systems.

I made this for myself to help me study for the CompTIA Sec+ SY0-701 exam and thought someone else might find it useful.

Questions section:
  For the questions.txt file, the qeustions have to be formatted as follows:
    number period space question
    6. What is the proper way to spell 'dog'?
    a) ogd
    b) god
    c) dog
    d) odg

Answers section:
  For the answers.txt file, the answers have to be formatted as follows (case does not matter):
    number period space letter
    1. a 
    2. b 
    3. c

Flow of the program:
  • To begin, you select the location of your questions.txt file.
  • Next you select the location of the answers.txt file.
  • Then you can start your quiz.
  • As you progress, your current correct answer total is shown below the current question.
  • When you complete the quiz, you are presented with a results page.
      Here you will see your total score and have the ability to select a button to see your incorrect answers.
        The incorrect answer section shows the question, your incorrect answer, and the correct answer.
  • Also in the results window, you have the option to exit or restart the quiz.
      If you restart the quiz, you need to select your questions.txt and answers.txt files.

** Note: The only limit to the amount of questions is what you have in questions.txt.
